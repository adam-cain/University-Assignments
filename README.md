### Year 3
- **COMP315 - Cloud Computing for E-Commerce**: 
  - Assignments focused on building a dynamic and reactive e-commerce front-end website. The coursework involves:
    - **JavaScript for Data Cleaning**: Implementing a set of functions to perform data cleaning operations on a dataset, showcasing proficiency in JavaScript.
    - **TypeScript and React for E-Commerce Front-End**: Expanding a provided skeleton program to develop a dynamic and reactive e-commerce front-end website using TypeScript and React, enhancing user experience and responsiveness.
- **COMP319 - Software Engineering II**: 
  - Design a class structure for a Space Invaders game, implementing object-oriented techniques and patterns such as Factory, Chain of Responsibility, Singleton, Open-Closed Principle, and Single Responsibility Principle. The implementation includes creating a model-only version of the game without rendering or gameplay, focusing on design quality.
- **COMP329 - Autonomous Mobile Robotics**: 
  - Implement obstacle avoidance algorithms (Bug 1 and Bug 2) for a robot to navigate from a start location to an end location within a specified environment. The project includes developing a robot controller, avoiding obstacles dynamically, tracking travel distance, and documenting the approach and performance in a report.
